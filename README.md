ruby-rectangle-intersection
================

Usage
-----

Run `ruby main.rb`

Programming
-----------

The main algorithm is implemented in `main.rb`, it's a
[Sweep Line Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line) for detecting
intersecting rectangles.

Needed data structures are `sweep_line_status` and the `event_point_schedule`.

It's not giving back any kind of data structures, it just prints out
intersecting rectangles.

TL;DR
-----

An implementation in ruby that finds intersections of given rectangles. It was
a homework. `main.rb` for details
